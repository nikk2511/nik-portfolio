# Profile Image Instructions

To add your profile image to the portfolio:

1. **Save your profile image** as `profile.jpg` in this folder (`public/images/`)
2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 400x400 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - Quality: High resolution for crisp display
   - File name: `profile.jpg`

3. **The image will automatically appear** in the hero section of the portfolio

4. **Fallback behavior:** If the image fails to load, the portfolio will show "NS" initials as a fallback

## Current Status
